\noindent While the progenitor model of long GRBs is widely accepted, the progenitors of short GRBs are not well understood. With potential gravitational wave detections a few years out, broad-band observations of short GRB afterglows provide essential information on the energetics and geometries of these events. Using X-ray, optical and radio data, I present the most current demographics of short GRBs in terms of their energies, circumburst densities and opening angles. I will then compare these observations to the rates we expect for various progenitor models.
