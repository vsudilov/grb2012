\noindent The Band model is currently the standard empirical model for fitting GRB spectra. Deviations from this model at low energies were originally reported by Preece et al. 1996 using BATSE data. More recently, additional spectral components, have been identified in specific GRBs observed by Fermi-GBM. In this work, we search for low-energy spectral deviations in a sample of bright GBM GRBs. This has been done by fitting GBM spectra using automated software, such that deviations can be identified and their significance quantified. We have investigated time-integrated and time-resolved spectra of the most fluent 46 GBM bursts from the first 2 years.
