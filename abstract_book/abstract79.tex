\noindent A clear evidence of two components in GRB 101023 has been outlined. The first episode has been fit by a black body plus power-law spectral model. The temperature changes with time following a broken power-law, and the photon index presents a soft-to-hard evolution. The second episode appears to be a canonical GRB. Using the Amati and Atteia relations we determined the cosmological redshift to be $z \sim 0.9 \pm 0.08$ (stat.) $\pm 0.2$ (sys.). This source appears to be a twin of GRB 090618, and appear to be related to a single core collapse: the first episode is related to the proto-black hole and the second one to a canonical GRB. We are exploring the possibility to extend these considerations to GRB 110709B. GRB 110709B has been detected by Konus Wind and Swift in the high energy band, and
