\noindent Thanks to Swift, rapid follow-up studies of GRBs are possible. About 1/3 of all GRBs observed by Swift has measured redshift (an enormous improvement with respect to the pre-Swift era). Salvaterra et al recently defined a subsample of Swift GRBs with 90\% of redshift completeness, based on favorable observing conditions (Jakobsonn et al.) and prompt brightness. We present their spectral properties and for the first time investigate the spectral-energy correlations in a sample unaffected by biases induced by the measurement of $z$. Using the complete sample as reference, we simulate samples of GRBs to probe the role of the flux threshold on the E$_\mathrm{p}$-L relation. We found that the use of flux limited samples in correlation studies cannot be responsible for the existence of the correlation itself.
