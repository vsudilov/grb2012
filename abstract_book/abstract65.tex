\noindent The Italian-French GRB host program is one of the X-shooter GTO programs. It started at the end of 2009 and allowed us to collect the spectra of about 30 host galaxies in the 300-2400nm range from a redshift of about z=0.1 to z=2.7. In this talk I will present the status of the program, showing some of the new results obtained in both slit and IFU modes.
