\noindent The cosmological nature of gamma-ray bursts (GRB) makes their optical counterparts to experience a well known attenuation due to light passing through intergalactic absorbers in the GRB lines-of-sight. Without the knowledge of the number of absorbers and their physical properties, the effect of absorption on the observed magnitudes can not be determined. Different methods have been applied in order to correct for this effect statistically, either using semi-analytical calculations or numerical simulations. We follow these works and present the expected magnitude corrections as a function of redshift for a set of filters most commonly used by the scientific community. We discuss the applications of our results with respect to GRB science.
