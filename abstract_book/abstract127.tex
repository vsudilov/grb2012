\noindent The double burst, GRB 110709B, triggered Swift/BAT twice at 21:32:39 UT and
21:43:45 UT, respectively, on 9 July 2011. This is the first time we observed a
GRB with two BAT triggers. In this work, we present simultaneous Swift and
Konus-WIND observations of this unusual GRB and its afterglow. If the two
events are from the same physical origin, their different time-dependent
spectral evolution suggest that they must belong to different episodes of the
central engine, which may be a magnetar-to-BH accretion system.
