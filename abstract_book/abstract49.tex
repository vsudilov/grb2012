\noindent In the standard view describing the nature of long GRB emission, the duration of the central engine activity has been usually considered to be 
much shorter that the afterglow emission variability time-scales.
The discussion on the nature of X-ray flares and the recent studies on pre and post cursor emission observed in the gamma rays unveiled the possibility that the central engine can be characterized by a much longer activity. In this work we discuss the signatures of late-time central engine activity from a different perspective, i.e., in the temporal and spectral variability of the optical-NIR afterglow. We will discuss these signatures of the long lasting central engine activity unveiled thanks to the rich multicolor light-cureves obtained by the GROND instrument.
