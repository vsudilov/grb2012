\noindent In all GRBs models, magnetic fields are important and play a very dramatic
role. In particular in the synchroton afterglow emission the downstream
magnetic field, implied by afterglow observations in GRBs, is higher than
that of the upstream field, by a factor $\sim$ $10^6$. Observations
indicates that the magnetic field in the downstream region must remain high
over distances $10^{10}$ $\delta$, where $\delta$ is the plasma skin depth. In order to understand the behavior of magnetic fields in the evolution of the GRB jets, we have performed relativistic MHD (RMHD) simulations, taking into account the radiative losses to the external medium. Here we show the amplification of the magnetic fields by shock compression and how it is influenced by the cooling effects.
