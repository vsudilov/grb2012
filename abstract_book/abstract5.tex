\noindent We present the analysis of a sample of bright Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) showing emission up to more than 1 MeV, which were collected during the first 3.5 years of Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) operations.
We derive the durations of GRBs (T90) in the observer\'s frame in various energy bands up to 10 MeV, thus expanding the durationâ€“energy relationship in the GRB light curves to high energies. Finally we compare our analysis with previous results.
For several bursts we notice evidence of a possible cutoff or break at higher energies in the duration vs. energy distributions and investigate this
behavior by relating it with the spectral properties of GRBs.
