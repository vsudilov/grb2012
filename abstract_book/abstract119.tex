\noindent The cosmic gamma-ray burst (GRB) rate is essential for revealing the connection between GRBs, supernovae and stellar evolution. Also, the GRB rate at high redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early universe. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to determine the intrinsic GRB rate due to Swiftâ€™s complex trigger algorithm (with > 500 trigger criteria). Current studies usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm by a single detection threshold. To investigate possible systematic biases and explore the intrinsic cosmic GRB rate and luminosity function, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach by simulating all trigger criteria of Swift. We will discuss how our results impact on star formation at high redshift and the supernova-GRB relation.
