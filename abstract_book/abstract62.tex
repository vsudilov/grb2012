\noindent I give a brief review of what we know about GRB-selected galaxies. The heterogeneous nature of this population of galaxies highlights the fact that careful selection is a prerequisite for studying their statistical properties. I introduce The Optically Unbiased GRB Host (TOUGH) sample of 69 Swift GRB host galaxies spanning the redshift range 0.03-6.30 and announce the  results of a large observational survey of these galaxies.
