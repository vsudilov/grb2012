\noindent I will present results from a statistical analysis of all Swift detected GRBs and show that there is a clear connection between the prompt emission detected in the BAT and the X-ray afterglow observed by the Swift XRT. The results show that burst with long T90 have also longer plateau phases. Also the spectral slopes of the BAT emission and the XRT afterglow are well-correlated. The GRB properties were also analyzed with multi-variate statistical tools such as Principal Component Analysis and Cluster Analysis and results from this analysis will also be presented.
