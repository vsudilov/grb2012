\noindent Until 24/02/2012 Swift triggered 638 GRBs.  The basic gamma, X-ray and optical parameters of the bursts are listed in Swift archive.  A large fraction of the bursts are detected only in the gamma and not in the X-ray and/or the optical range.  We applied Boolean factor analysis for studying detection/non detection patterns of the variables.  We showed that these detection/non detection patterns can be characterized by 6 boolean factors.  These factors enable us to identify groups of GRBs with similar observational patterns.  We briefly discuss the physical differences between these groups.
