\noindent We analyze the time-resolved spectra of bright, long, single/separable pulses of Fermi GRBs. We find that the peak energy/temperature always decreases exponentially with fluence in the later part. We investigate multiple spectral components in the initial rising part and provide a comprehensive empirical description of the spectral and timing behavior of single pulses. We extend the work of Basak \\& Rao (2012a ApJ745,76; 2012b ApJ, acc.) to make a pulse-wise parametrization of GRBs. We analyze all Fermi GRBs with known redshifts and demonstrate that the peak energy/kT at zero fluence shows a very strong correlation with the energy of  individual pulses. This work strongly extends the possibility of using GRB pulses as standard candles and the spectral parameters as a proxy for redshift.
