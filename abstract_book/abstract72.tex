\noindent The GBM instrument onboard the Fermi spacecraft currently operates on several trigger algorithms on various time scales and energy bands.
Motivated by the pursuit of faint GRBs (e.g. the elusive class of low-luminosity GRBs), I will present the results of my search for these GRBs in the GBM data. To this end, I will demonstrate the methods and algorithms which have been developed by the GBM team.
As a first result, I am going to highlight the spectral analysis of GRBs which triggered the Swift satellite, but not GBM although they were in the field of view of the latter. I will then compare the properties of these GRBs to the full sample of GBM GRBs published in the GBM spectral catalogue.
I estimate that the lower limit for untriggered GRBs in the GBM data is about 1.6 events per month.
