\noindent The Interplanetary Network Database, at ssl.berkeley.edu/ipn3, is composed of three main sections.
1.	A GRB bibliography containing over 11000 references from 1972 to the present, updated roughly every day,
2.	A master list of gamma-ray and SGR bursts with over 25000 events from 1990 to the present, updated roughly every month, and
3.	A table of over 7000 GRB localizations from 1990 to the present, updated roughly daily.
A detailed description of each of these sections is given, with indications of how to use the various datasets, and descriptions of the projects which are now underway to simplify web access to the localization data.
