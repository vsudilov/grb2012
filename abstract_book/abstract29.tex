\noindent The X-ray absorption in GRBs has been seen as a potential goldmine of information on material invisible at other wavelengths. Many proposals have been made to account for it, including ionisation of the GRB progenitorâ€™s molecular cloud, intrinsic curvature of the X-ray spectra, and absorption by the warm-hot intergalactic medium.  However the correct solution to its origin has not been arrived at after more than a decade of work. I will present recent work on the X-ray absorption in GRBs that resolves the  problem of its apparent evolution with redshift by showing that a strong dust obscuration bias is responsible. I will then go on, using UV/optical data to suggest and demonstrate the solution to the remaining outstanding problems, and finally explain the nature of the X-ray absorber.
