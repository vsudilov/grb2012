\noindent We present the results of the search for an optical precursor to the naked-eye burst - GRB080319B, which reached 5.87m optical peak luminosity in the 'Pi of the Sky' data. A burst of such a high brightness could have been preceded by an optical precursor luminous enough to be in detection range of our experiment. The 'Pi of the Sky' cameras observed the coordinates of the GRB for about 20 minutes prior to the explosion, thus provided crucial data for the precursor search. No signal within 3 sigma limit was found. A limit of 12m (V-band equivalent) was set based on the data combined from two cameras, the most robust limit to our knowledge for this precursor.
