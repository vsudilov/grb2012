\noindent The connection between long GRBs and supernovae is now well established. I will review the evidence in favor of - or against - it. I will attempt to separate solid facts from  weak evidence, interesting clues from red herrings. I will also look at what we  can learn from looking at SNe not associated with GRBs and see how GRBs fit into the broad picture of stellar explosions.
