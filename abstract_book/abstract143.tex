\noindent We summarize the results of a deep 
imaging of Swift/XRT error circles 
of optically dark gamma-ray bursts.
We find that a relatively large fraction of the corresponding host galaxy candidates are dust-enshrouded galaxies. This supports the idea that extinction by dust plays an important role in the 
optical dimming of these events.
