\noindent In this poster we present the main spectral and temporal properties of GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM. We investigate the key properties of GRBs in the rest-frame of the progenitor and test for possible intra-parameter correlations to better understand the intrinsic nature of these events.
Our sample comprises the 32 GRBs published by Gruber et al. 2011 together with all GBM GRBs with measured redshift found since August 2010 up to February 2012. For all of these events we derive $E_{\\rm p,rest}$, $T_{90,{\\rm rest}}$ and $E_{\\rm iso}$. We confirm the tight correlation between and $E_{\\rm p,rest}$ and $E_{\\rm iso}$ and the one between $E_{\\rm p,rest}$ and the 1-s peak luminosity ($L_p$). Moreover, we do not find any significant cosmic evolution of $E_{\\rm p,rest}$ or $T_{90,{\\rm rest}}$.
