\noindent The central engines of AGNs and GRBs share the same basic astrophysical ingredients - despite the vastly different mass scales - and an outstanding question is how the jet physics scales from GRBs to AGNs. Using Fermi and Swift, we show that the jets produced by blazars and long-duration GRBs exhibit similar correlations between the kinetic power and apparent gamma-ray luminosity. After beaming corrections, we find evidence that blazars and GRBs follow the same correlation between the *intrinsic* Lgamma and kinetic power. This result implies that jet production and energy dissipation mechanisms are remarkably similar across 9 orders of magnitude in luminosity. We will discuss the implications of these results in terms of the properties of the central engines.
