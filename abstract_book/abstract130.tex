\noindent The UFFO Pathfinder mission, to be mounted on the Lomonosov spacecraft for launch in June 2012, will attempt to locate and image the optical afterglow of a GRB within seconds of detection by an X-ray imager.

It consists of two instruments, UBAT - a coded mask X-ray imager whose primary function is to detect and locate a GRB and determine its direction vector, and SMT - an optical imager which will then rotate a moveable mirror to lock onto the GRB direction vector within a second and direct the optical afterglow to a camera with ~17 arcmin field of view.

We present here the design of UBAT/SMT along with the results of simulations for expected GRB types to show the minimal integration times required to obtain a GRB location within an error radius that will put 95% within the SMT FOV.
