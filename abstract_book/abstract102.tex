\noindent We report the result to search for the late-time hard X-ray emission 
associated to Swift GRBs by processing the BAT survey data.  We are 
interested in investigating a weak hard X-ray emission especially during 
a shallow decay phase in the Swift/XRT light curves, and also, a coincident 
hard X-ray emission during the late-time flare seen by Swift/XRT.  In 
GRB 050525A, we found the significant hard X-ray emission by BAT up to 1 day 
after the burst in our processing.  This interesting result should provide 
a crucial information to understand the afterglow emission by combining 
other multi-wavelength data.  We present the BAT survey processing 
results of whole known-z Swift GRB samples.
