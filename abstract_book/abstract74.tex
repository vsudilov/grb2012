\noindent Since the early 90s Gamma Ray Bursts have been accepted to be of extra-galactic origin thanks to the isotropic distribution observed by BATSE and the redshifts observed in some of their optical or infrared counterparts. Nevertheless, there have been a few cases that upon further examination have turned out to be of galactic origin. In this work we will conduct several statistical analyses to determine the degree of contamination by galactic sources of different samples taken from the Swift GRB catalog. This poster will detail the proposed methodology.
