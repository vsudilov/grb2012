\noindent I will review the properties of the prompt emission in long and short duration gamma ray burst and the models that have been suggested to explain their features. I will discuss the pros and cons of each model and focus on recent theoretical developments suggesting that the long-GRB prompt emission comes from a combination of mechanisms, with photospheric radiation playing a key role. The implication of this for the short GRBs will be discussed.
