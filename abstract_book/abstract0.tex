\noindent After 7.5 years of operations and more than 700 detected GRBs, Swift continues to provide both surprises and insight into the Universe’s most exciting transient phenomena.  Swift operations remain efficient, including a new capability to more easily follow-up transients detected by other observatories.  In this talk, I will highlight recent GRB results that demonstrate Swift’s unique capabilities, and discuss potential areas of study in the future.
