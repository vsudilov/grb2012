\noindent In the present work, we focus on the interplay between stochastic acceleration of charged particles and radiation processes in a region of turbulent magnetized plasma, setting the framework for an “one-zone” radiation-acceleration model for GRB afterglows. Specifically, we assume that the particle distribution is isotropic in space and treat in detail the particle propagation in momentum-space. The electron distribution is modified by the acceleration, radiation (synchrotron/SSC) and escape processes.  The magnetic field and the particle injection rate and energy are functions of  time as measured in the co-moving frame of the blast wave.  We numerically solve the time-dependent Fokker-Planck equation and present characteristic examples for the obtained particle and photon spectra.
