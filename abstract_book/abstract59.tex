\noindent The possibility of GRBs as the source of UHECR is currently starting to get constrained by the non-observation of GRB neutrinos. We therefore reconsider the current neutrino flux predictions
from gamma-ray observations, based on the internal shock model, from the particle physics involved, and numerically calculate the resulting spectra. At the example of the Waxman-Bahcall GRB neutrino flux we demonstrate how additional production modes, synchrotron cooling of secondary particles, and flavor mixing affect the expected neutrino spectrum. We demonstrate that a detailed (numerical) calculation changes the prediction of the GRB neutrino flux from gamma-ray observations, apply this to the recent IC40 GRB results, and discuss systematical and astrophysical uncertainties of this interpretation.
