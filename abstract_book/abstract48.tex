\noindent We numerically investigate jet propagation in various types of massive GRB progenitors and try to constrain to the nature of the central engine. In this study, two dimensional axisymmetric simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics are performed with taking into account both the stellar collapse and the jet propagation. In our simulations, the power of jet is determined by two different origin of central engine (accretion-powered central engine and neutrino-driven central engine). We calculate the accretion rate and the evolution of black hole mass and spin, all of which are necessary to evaluate the jet power. In this conference, I would like to show you a simple jet breakout criteria and also give constraints on the angular momentum distribution of Wolf-Rayet stars to produce GRBs.
