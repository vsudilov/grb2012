\noindent The recent observations by the Fermi GBM detectors have given the possibility to study for
the first time a genuine short GRB, GRB 090227B, with energy E=(1.13 $\pm$ 0.12)$\times$ 10$^{54}$ ergs and
baryon load B=10$^{-6}$. Under such conditions, the theoretical understanding of the electron-
positron plasma allows to estimate the Lorentz gamma factor at transparency, Gamma=12852, and, consequently, to determine its cosmological redshift, z=4.07 $\pm$ 0.36.
