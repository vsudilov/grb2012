\noindent Until now, seven intervening sub-DLAs and DLAs have been reported towards six GRBs. Although their chemical composition and frequency is known from quasar studies, the knowledge of their galaxy counterparts is limited. In this talk, I present the findings on the first systematic search for galaxy counterparts of intervening sub-DLAs/DLAs towards GRBs. To identify their galaxy counterparts, very deep imaging campaigns and low-resolution spectra were used. This approach allowed the identification of one high-z DLA galaxy. I also discuss the limits on the non-detections and report a redshift co-incidence of different objects associated with metal-lines in the same field that are separated by 137-161 kpc.
