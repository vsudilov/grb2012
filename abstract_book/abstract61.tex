\noindent Presently there are only some 30% of short gamma ray bursts (SGRBs) with reasonably firm redshifts, and this sample is highly biased by the limited sensitivity of Swift to detect SGRBs. We account for the dominant biases to calculate a realistic SGRB rate density out to z = 0.5 using the Swift sample of peak fluxes, redshifts, and those SGRBs with a beaming angle constraint from X-ray/optical observations. Assuming a significant fraction of binary neutron star mergers produce SGRBs, we calculate lower and upper detection rate limits of (1-200) per Yr by an ALIGO and Virgo coincidence search. Our detection rate is similar to the lower and realistic rates inferred from extrapolations using Galactic pulsar observations and population synthesis.
