\noindent We address the open problem of "missing" jet breaks in Swift XRT afterglows by fitting afterglows of 34 GRBs with detailed Swift data and late-time Chandra observations to jet models obtained from high resolution hydrodynamics simulations  (van Eerten and MacFadyen 2012a,b,c; 2011a, b).  These detailed models allow us to determine GRB jet parameters, including jet break times, jet opening angle, observer angle, shock-accelerated electron distribution and GRB energies,  with higher fidelity than allowed by previous afterglow fits based on analytic approximations to the jet evolution.  I will present preliminary results from this work.
