\noindent Evidence is mounting that some (long) GRB host galaxies are metal rich, massive, and dusty, with high star-formation rates, rather than the low-metallicity, low-mass hosts commonly found at z less than 1. We present new Herschel sub-mm observations of a small sample of GRB host galaxies, associated with dark GRBs, and compile spectral energy distributions (SEDs) which span roughly
a factor of 1000 in wavelength.  SED fitting gives stellar mass, bolometric
luminosity, and star-formation rate, and we discuss these results in the
context of galaxy demographics at redshifts up to 2.
