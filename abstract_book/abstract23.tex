\noindent We present the first multi-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of GRB jets for both uniform and stratified external media. The simulations are performed in two dimensions using a newly developed, special relativistic, adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code. 
We describe the differences in the dynamics of the GRB jet as a function of the stratification of the ambient medium and, by post-processing the results of the simulations with a radiation code, we compute the afterglow emission from the GRB as it decelerates from highly relativistic to Newtonian velocities. The implications for observations of the afterglow lightcurves, jet breaks and radio calorimetry are described in detail in the talk.
