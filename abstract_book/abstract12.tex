\noindent We do not have a valid and robust explanation of the spectral energy correlations. Some light, however, have been shed by the recently found correlation between the bulk Lorentz factor and both the peak energy and the isotropic peak luminosity output of the prompt. Based on this result, we explore its consequences for the spectral energy correlations, finding, through extensive simulations, that they are real. Furthermore GRBs should be characterized by a preferred opening angle of their jets, and a preferred bulk Lorentz factor. These two quantities are related: the narrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk Lorentz factor.
