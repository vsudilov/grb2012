\noindent The merger of compact binary systems are generally considered as the standard
central engines of sGRBs, but this hypothesis is far from being proven.
Progress is expected from combining the information obtained in different channels.
I will discuss the signatures extracted from a large set of simulated compact binary
mergers. They include gravitational waves and neutrinos, but the main focus will be
on the electromagnetic signatures that result from the dynamically ejected
matter. I will also discuss the potential of dynamical collisions of compact objects
as sGRB engines and the question in which ways such collisions differ from
gravitational wave driven mergers.
