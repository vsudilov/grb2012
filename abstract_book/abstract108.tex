\noindent We show the gamma-ray, X-ray, optical and radio data of GRB100814A. At the end of the slow decline phase of the X-ray and optical afterglow, we have a sudden and prominent rebrightening in the optical band, followed by a fast decay in both bands. This optical rebrightening also appears to show chromatic variations.
We discuss the possible interpretations, with their advantages and drawbacks. We find that it is rather difficult to explain the behavior of GRB100814A within a basic model of single component emission produced by external shocks.
We also indicate other Swift bursts that show optical rebrightenings with similar properties. Since a two-component model requires some degree of fine tuning to explain the observed feature, we point out that even this scenario may look contrived.
