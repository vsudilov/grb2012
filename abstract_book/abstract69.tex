\noindent We have investigated the variability of a sample of long and short Fermi/GBM Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) using a fast wavelet technique to determine shortest variability time scales. The results indicate different short variability time scales for long and short bursts in the source frame and that variabilities on the order of a few milliseconds are not uncommon. The data also indicate an intriguing relation between shortest variability time scale and the burst durations.
