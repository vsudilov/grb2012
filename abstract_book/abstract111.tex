\noindent We selected a complete sub-sample of Swift bright long GRBs in order to study the properties of GRBs and their afterglows on a statistical basis. To select the sample we considered bursts with favorable observing conditions for ground-based follow-up optical/NIR observations and whit the 1 second peak flux in the 15-150 keV energy band above a flux threshold of 2.6 ph/cm2/s. This sample, made of 58 bursts, has also a redshift completeness level higher than 90%. We will use this complete sample to discuss the properties of long GRBs and their evolution with cosmic times. We will also investigate the correlation between various prompt and afterglow properties and discuss the nature of dark bursts.
