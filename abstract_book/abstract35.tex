\noindent I will review the basic theoretical framework for the formation of the first stars and galaxies. High-redshift gamma-ray bursts are among the most promising probes of this crucial epoch of first light. We will learn about the properties of individual first star progenitors, the cosmic star formation rate at high redshifts, and the ionization structure and metal enrichment of the early intergalactic medium.
