\noindent Gamma-ray bursts are among the most violent events observed in the
universe, and their progenitors are likely to emit copious amounts of
gravitational waves. We present the results of searches for
gravitational waves associated with gamma-ray bursts in the 2009-2010
data from the LIGO and Virgo network of gravitational wave
detectors. These searches are tailored towards the two
main gamma-ray burst progenitor models: the coalescence of a neutron
star with another compact object and extreme cases of stellar
core-collapse. We also discuss the prospects of future observations in
the era of advanced gravitational wave detectors.
