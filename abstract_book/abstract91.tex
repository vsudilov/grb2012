\noindent We searched for short X-ray transients in the 15 month data of Monitor of All-sky X-ray Image (MAXI) in the 4.0-10.0 keV energy band.  MAXI scans most of the sky every 92 minutes with a narrow fan-beamed field of view with a typical transit time of 50 seconds.  In this study, we searched for transient sources that are detected in single scans of MAXI/GSC at Galactic latitudes larger than 20 degrees.  As a result, we found 29 transients with the fluctuation probability of less than 10$^{-8}$.
Eight of them coincides with prompt emission of GRBs reported to GCN, and one identified as the afterglow of a reported GRB.
Three transients are positionally coincident with flare stars, and other two with known X-ray sources.  
The other 15 transients remained unidentified.
