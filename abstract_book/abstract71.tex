\noindent I will present the comoving frame properties of GRBs whose Gamma_0 can be estimated from the peak of their afterglow light curve. Typical values of Gamma_0 are ~138 and ~66, if the circum-burst density is constant or if it scales as a wind profile respectively. The distribution of the comoving frame Liso\' is very narrow  with a typical value ~5e48 erg/s. Intriguingly, there exist tight correlations between Eiso or Liso and Gamma_0 which offer a general interpretation scheme for the spectral--energy correlation of GRBs: the Ep-Eiso and Ep-Liso correlations are due to a sequence of Gamma_0 factors. The collimation-corrected correlation, can be explained  if theta^2*Gamma_0=constant. Finally, we find a typical theta*Gamma_0 ~ 6-20 in agreement with magnetically accelerated jets models.
