\noindent Based on recent theoretical models and observations, I will show that there was an historic cosmic evolution of stellar black holes, which implied the formation of large populations of stellar black holes during the dark ages. I will propose that following the observation of GRBs with Fermi, exciting perspectives will be open with the Cherenkov Telescope Array (CTA).
