\noindent We present high resolution numerical simulations in 1D and 2D of two ultra-relativistic shells colliding in the afterglow phase of a GRB. For the 1D case we construct optical and radio light curves and examine the occurrence of flares assuming a spherical explosion and a hard-edged jet scenario. We establish a connection between the characteristics of the flare and the properties of the flow. For the 2D case we examine the propagation of a narrow 2 degrees half-opening angle jet and investigate the dynamical effects resulting from the energy injection in the external shell. We find an angular dependency of the collision time due to extraction of energy from the external shock and comment on the signatures this behaviour might have in optical light curves.
