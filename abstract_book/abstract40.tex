\noindent I would like to review the numerical study on the central engine of Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursts (LGRBs). Mainly I would like to review the history and current status of collapsar model and magnetar model. I would like to present my numerical simulations of collapsar model using 2D/3D Generala Relativistic MHD code. I would like to explain Blandford-Znajek Process as a possible key process of the engine of LGRBs. I would also like to show our 2D MHD simulations of magnetar model.
