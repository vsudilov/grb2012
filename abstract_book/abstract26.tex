\noindent At this conference, I will provide evidence for a new intrinsic correlation between the decay rate and brightness of the optical afterglow, determined using a sample of 56 long GRB optical/UV light curves. This correlation has (at least) two possible origins: the energy is released more quickly for bright afterglows, or the energy is released at a similar rate in all afterglows, but we are observing the jets over a wide range of angles. In the latter scenario the fainter, slower-decaying afterglows will be viewed at larger angles than the brighter, faster-decaying afterglows. I will discuss these possible causes and the consequences on GRB afterglow physics. This correlation represents a major step towards toward a full, unified characterisation of the long GRB population.
