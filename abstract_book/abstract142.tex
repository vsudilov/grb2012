\noindent In this talk I will present the redshift results from a VLT FORS/ISAAC programme aimed at optimizing the legacy value of the Swift mission: to characterize a homogeneous, X-ray selected, sample of 69 GRB host galaxies. At least 15 new redshifts have been secured, resulting in an approximately 75% redshift completion of the sample, making it the most comprehensive in terms of redshift completeness to date. I present the cumulative redshift distribution and derive a conservative, yet small, associated uncertainty. Finally, the fraction of Swift GRBs at high redshift is constrained.
