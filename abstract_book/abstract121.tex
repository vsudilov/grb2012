\noindent We investigate whether stellar-mass black holes have to receive natal kicks in order to explain the observed distribution of low-mass X-ray binaries containing black holes within our Galaxy. Such natal kicks will affect the production of compact BH-NS binaries which are possible GRB progenitors.
We combine population synthesis  with integrations of binary systems within the Galactic potential. We find that in a number of cases, natal kicks are in fact necessary. Further, we find that the distribution of natal kicks would seem to be similar to that of neutron stars. This result is somewhat surprising; in many pictures of stellar-mass black-hole formation, one might have expected black holes to receive kicks having the same momentum (rather than the same speed) as those given to neutron star
