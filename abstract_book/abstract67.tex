\noindent The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has triggered on 881 cosmic gamma-ray bursts (GRBs) between trigger enabling on  2008 July 12, and 2012 February 28. The 2nd GBM GRB catalog will contain GRBs from years three and four in the mission, and is currently in preparation. This second catalog will continue the first catalog (Paciesas et al. 2012), which includes 491 GRBs. I will summarize basic characteristics of the triggered GRBs, such as locations, durations, peak fluxes and fluences. An analysis of these quantities of the total GRB sample will be presented. This catalog is an official product of the Fermi GBM science team, and the data files containing the complete results will be available from the High-Energy Astrophysics Science Archive Research Center (HEASARC).
