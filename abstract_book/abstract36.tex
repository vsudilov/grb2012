\noindent We calculate the theoretical event rate of gamma-ray bursts (GRBs)  from the collapse of massive first-generation stars (Pop III). The Pop III GRBs could be super-energetic, providing a unique probe of the high-redshift Universe. We employ a semi-analytical approach that considers inhomogeneous hydrogen reionization and chemical evolution of the intergalactic medium. We also discuss the best strategies to observe and identify these objects.
