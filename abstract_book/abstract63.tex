\noindent Host galaxies are an excellent means of probing the natal environments that generate gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Surveys of long-duration GRB (LGRB) host environments and their ISM properties have produced intriguing new results with important implications for LGRB progenitor models. These host studies are also critical in evaluating the utility of LGRBs as potential tracers of star formation and metallicity at high redshifts, particularly when considering the implications for properties of host galaxies above z = 6. I will summarize the latest research on LGRB host galaxies, and discuss the resulting impact on our understanding of these events\' progenitors, energetics, afterglow properties, and cosmological applications.
