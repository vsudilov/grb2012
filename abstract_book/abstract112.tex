\noindent We perform a statistical analysis of the incidence of very strong  MgII absorbers ($W_r$(MgII) > 1 $\AA$) using the largest set of afterglow spectra available in the literature. This include low and high resolution spectra as well as data obtained even before the advent of the Swift satellite. More than 100 spectra were included and we compare our dn/dz estimate with previous works with the intent to solve once for all this intriguing puzzle. We used different metrics and  carefully described the possible biases and systematics involved in different studies which, ultimately, can produce inconsistent results.
