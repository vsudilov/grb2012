\noindent Spectral lags in Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs), wherein low energy photons
arrive at later times than the high energy photons, have been observed
in a significant number of bursts. Spectral lags have been attributed
to curvature effects in GRBs. In this scenario, the relativistic GRB
jet is assumed to be a cone with a certain opening angle. Photons that
are off-axis relative to the observer arrive at later times than
on-axis photons. In this work, we test GRB data for spectral lags and
other such curvature effects by invoking a relatively simple
kinematic, two-shell collision model for a uniform jet profile. We
have isolated single pulse structures in the BATSE, Swift-BAT, and
Fermi-GBM GRB samples.  We present the preliminary results of our
analysis.
