\noindent We compared the physical parameters (e.g. temporal decay index, spectral index) of the intermediate and long grb afterglows. 
The grbs were chosen from the sample used in Veres et al., ApJ, 725, pp. 1955–1964, 2010.
Both the long and intermediate afterglow data set consist the same number of afterglows,
and the redshift distributions are the same as well.
The afterglow data was taken from the Swift UVOT archive system, and the
data reduction was carried out using the Heasoft, version 6.11
