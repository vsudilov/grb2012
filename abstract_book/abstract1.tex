\noindent The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair-conversion detector of high-energy gamma rays of energies ranging from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. It operates in synergy with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), which covers the entire unocculted sky and is designed for gamma-ray transients\' detection and spectroscopy between 8 keV and 40 MeV. The LAT detects ~9 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) per year, which represents ~8% of the GBM bursts occuring in its field of view. We will present a systematic study of the GRB properties observed with the LAT, highlighting the unique characteristics of some individual bursts. We will also discuss the LAT non-detections of some GBM bright and hard bursts, in an effort to understand the difference in GRB rates from both instruments.
