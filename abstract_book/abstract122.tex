\noindent We investigate the chemical dependence of the progenitors of long gamma-ray bursts (LGRBs). Using hydrodynamical cosmological simulations consistent with the concordance $\\Lambda$-CDM model which include star formation, chemical enrichment and Supernovae feedback in a self-consistent way, and assuming that LGRBs are produced by massive stars with a possible chemical dependence, we compute the LGRB rate at different redshifts. Introducing a prescription for their peak luminosity function and intrinsic spectrum, and using a Monte Carlo scheme to model their detectability by different high-energy observatories, we compute the distribution of their observables (peak flux, spectral peak energy). In this poster we present our preliminary results compared with current observations.
