\noindent I will present the latest observations from major programs on Spitzer, HST, Keck, and Gemini targeting the hosts of over 20 GRBs with highly dust-suppressed afterglows, as well as efforts to search for long-wavelength host emission using the EVLA and CSO.  Many dark GRB hosts are extremely red and IR-luminous, suggesting that GRBs can indeed form in massive and metal-enriched systems, bolstering their utility as a cosmic SFR probe and imposing important constraints on the progenitor.  However, radio/submillimeter observations indicate they are mostly not super-starbursting galaxies like local ULIRGs.  Many other dark GRB hosts are actually quite blue and have low stellar masses, confirming that even ordinary and seemingly dust-free systems can host significant obscured star formation.
