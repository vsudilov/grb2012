\noindent We present results of simulations of magnetorotational(MR) supernovae explosion. MR mechanism is considered as possible central engine for gamma-ray bursts. It is shown that explosion energy depends on the mass of the collapsing iron core and initial rotation energy but weakly depends on the equation of state and details of neutrino transport.
