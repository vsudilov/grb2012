\noindent Compact binaries are important progenitors for gamma-ray bursts. Here we present simulations of the onset of mass transfer in compact binaries, focusing on systems containing a neutron star and a white dwarf. We make use of a modified form of smoothed particle hydrodynamics enabling us to model realistically-low mass transfer rates.
