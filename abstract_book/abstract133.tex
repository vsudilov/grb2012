\noindent A series of observations from October, 2009 to January, 2011 were carried out using 16 inch Schmidt Cassegrain telescope located at National Observatory, Nepal. The ring system of Saturn was focused by over-exposing the main body of the planet. A variation of relative flux density was studied along the ring system. As a result, inhomogeneous variation in flux from the ring system was found due to variation in composition of particles and, emission and absorption phenomena of particles present in the ring system. Possible explanation of the result will be presented.
