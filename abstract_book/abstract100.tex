\noindent We study the dynamics of jets triggered by tidal disruption of stars by supermassive black holes by multidimensional special relativistic hydrodynamics simulations. In particular, we properly determine the external medium stratification. We analyse in detail the effects of the external medium and the degree to which the jet dynamics is modified by its energy injection history.
