\noindent I present a comprehensive statistical analysis of Swift X-ray light-curves of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), with more than 650 GRBs. Two questions drive this effort: Does the X-ray emission retain any kind of memory of the prompt phase? Where is the dividing line between long and short GRBs? I show that Short GRBs decay faster, are less luminous and less energetic than long GRB, but are characterized by very similar intrinsic absorption. I furthermore reveal the existence of a number of statistically significant relations that link the X-ray to prompt parameters in long GRBs; short GRBs are outliers of the majority of these 2-par relations. More importantly, I report on the existence of a universal 3-parameter scaling that links the X-ray and the gamma-ray properties of BOTH long and short GRBs
