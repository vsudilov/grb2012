\noindent GRBs have proven to be powerful tools in studying the distant universe. Afterglows pinpoint star forming galaxies that would otherwise be  exceedingly difficult to discover. We present our methods and results of using 114 GRB fields observed between 2007-2012 with GROND, mounted at the ESO-MPG 2.2m telescope to find the global statistical properties of galaxies in close proximity to afterglow detections. In addition to comparing the angular correlation function on arc-minute scales to that of other field galaxies and AGN, the 7-band photometry for each field in our dataset allows us to constrain galactic properties such as (photometric) redshift, mass, and SFR. A comparison of these properties to the same from  normal field galaxies not selected by GRBs will shed light on the yet unsolved
