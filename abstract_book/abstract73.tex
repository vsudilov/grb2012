\noindent Recently thermal emission attracts attention as the origin of the GRB prompt emission and have been intensively investigated. However, the spectra and light curve are calculated only by superposing blackbody radiation emitted from the photosphere. In order to treat the thermal radiation from GRB jets properly, both the radiative transfer in the jets with complex structures should be taken into account.

We are developing a numerical code to calculate radiative transfer in the relativistic media, based on Monte-Carlo method. The code enables us to calculate the compton scattering by relativistic electrons as a postprocessing in relativistic media with complicate structures obtained by 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculation. We will report the status of development.
