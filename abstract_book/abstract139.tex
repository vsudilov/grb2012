\noindent We summarize observations of GRB host galaxies of short bursts (defined by T90) performed with the multi-channel imager GROND. The host galaxy population covers star-formation rates between about 0.01 and 100 solar masses per year. Our study supports the finding that this galaxy population is not dominated by passively evolving galaxies.
