1|1|talk|Swift: Status and Recent Results|Judith Racusin|NASA/GSFC|After 7.5 years of operations and more than 700 detected GRBs, Swift continues to provide both surprises and insight into the Universe’s most exciting transient phenomena.  Swift operations remain efficient, including a new capability to more easily follow-up transients detected by other observatories.  In this talk, I will highlight recent GRB results that demonstrate Swift’s unique capabilities, and discuss potential areas of study in the future.|Racusin|Judith~!
1|2|talk|Fermi LAT Status and Recent Results|F. Piron, for the Fermi LAT Collaboration|LUPM (CNRS/IN2P3 and Montpellier 2 University)|The Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) is a pair-conversion detector of high-energy gamma rays of energies ranging from 20 MeV to more than 300 GeV. It operates in synergy with the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM), which covers the entire unocculted sky and is designed for gamma-ray transients' detection and spectroscopy between 8 keV and 40 MeV. The LAT detects ~9 gamma-ray bursts (GRB) per year, which represents ~8% of the GBM bursts occuring in its field of view. We will present a systematic study of the GRB properties observed with the LAT, highlighting the unique characteristics of some individual bursts. We will also discuss the LAT non-detections of some GBM bright and hard bursts, in an effort to understand the difference in GRB rates from both instruments.|Piron|Frederic~!
1|3|talk|Scientific highlights from the Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor|Sheila McBreen on behalf of the GBM team|University College Dublin|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) is an all-sky instrument, sensitive in the 8 keV to 40 MeV energy range. GBM  detected over 900 Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) in the four years since the launch of Fermi and the Large Area Telescope detected ~8% of those within the overlapping field of view. The spectral and temporal properties of the GBM GRB sample will be described. In addition to GRBs, GBM has triggered on other transient sources, such as soft gamma repeaters, terrestrial gamma-ray flashes and solar flares. I will discuss the performance, data products and scientific highlights of GBM.|McBreen|Sheila~!
2|2|talk|Bright High-Energy GRBs detected with Fermi GBM|Elisabetta Bissaldi|UIBK|We present the analysis of a sample of bright Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs) showing emission up to more than 1 MeV, which were collected during the first 3.5 years of Fermi Gamma-Ray Burst Monitor (GBM) operations.
We derive the durations of GRBs (T$_{90}$) in the observer's frame in various energy bands up to 10 MeV, thus expanding the duration–energy relationship in the GRB light curves to high energies. Finally we compare our analysis with previous results.
For several bursts we notice evidence of a possible cutoff or break at higher energies in the duration vs. energy distributions and investigate this
behavior by relating it with the spectral properties of GRBs.|Bissaldi|Elisabetta~!
2|3|talk|Prompt spectral properties of a complete sample of Swift Gamma-Ray Bursts|L. Nava|APC Paris|Thanks to Swift, rapid follow-up studies of GRBs are possible. About 1/3 of all GRBs observed by Swift has measured redshift (an enormous improvement with respect to the pre-Swift era). Salvaterra et al recently defined a subsample of Swift GRBs with 90% of redshift completeness, based on favorable observing conditions (Jakobsonn et al.) and prompt brightness. We present their spectral properties and for the first time investigate the spectral-energy correlations in a sample unaffected by biases induced by the measurement of $z$. Using the complete sample as reference, we simulate samples of GRBs to probe the role of the flux threshold on the E$_\mathrm{p}$-L relation. We found that the use of flux limited samples in correlation studies cannot be responsible for the existence of the correlation itself.|Nava|Lara~!
2|1|talk|Rest-frame properties of GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM|David Gruber on behalf of the GBM team.|Max Planck Institute for Extraterrestrial Physics|We present the main spectral and temporal properties of GRBs observed by Fermi/GBM. We investigate the key properties of GRBs in the rest-frame of the progenitor and test for possible intra-parameter correlations to better understand the intrinsic nature of these events.
Our sample comprises the 32 GRBs published by Gruber et al. 2011 together with all GBM GRBs with measured redshift found since August 2010 up to February 2012. For all of these events we derive $E_{\rm p,rest}$, $T_{90,{\rm rest}}$ and $E_{\rm iso}$. We confirm the tight correlation between and $E_{\rm p,rest}$ and $E_{\rm iso}$ and the one between $E_{\rm p,rest}$ and the 1-s peak luminosity ($L_p$). Moreover, we do not find any significant cosmic evolution of $E_{\rm p,rest}$ or $T_{90,{\rm rest}}$.|Gruber|David~!
2|0|talk|The Fermi Era: Towards a better understanding of the GRB prompt emission|Sylvain Guiriec|NASA Goddard Space Flight Center / ORAU|Since 2008, prompt gamma-ray observations either by Fermi alone or jointly with Swift have changed our view of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs). While Fermi data reproduce globally the results obtained a decade ago by CGRO from keV to GeV,the new capabilities enabled us to go much further, towards a better understanding of GRB emission mechanisms and of the GRB phenomenon overall.
In the Fermi Era, the empirical Band function, traditionaly-used to fit GRB spectra, is not the paradigm any more. Deviation from Band and possible identification of physical components are discussed in the litterature.
Through this presentation we will come back on the Fermi observations published in the literature and discuss how they support or challenge the various mechanisms proposed to explain the observed emission.|Guiriec|Sylvain~!
3|3|talk|Relativistic MHD Simulations of Magnetic Fields in Jets of GRBs|Gustavo Rocha da Silva, Diego Falceta-Gonçalves, Elisabete M. de Gouveia Dal Pino|Universidade de São Paulo|In all GRBs models, magnetic fields are important and play a very dramatic
role. In particular in the synchroton afterglow emission the downstream
magnetic field, implied by afterglow observations in GRBs, is higher than
that of the upstream field, by a factor $\sim$ $10^6$. Observations
indicates that the magnetic field in the downstream region must remain high
over distances $10^{10}$ $\delta$, where $\delta$ is the plasma skin depth. In order to understand the behavior of magnetic fields in the evolution of the GRB jets, we have performed relativistic MHD (RMHD) simulations, taking into account the radiative losses to the external medium. Here we show the amplification of the magnetic fields by shock compression and how it is influenced by the cooling effects.|Rocha da Silva|Gustavo~!
3|2|talk|Multidimensional numerical simulations in the afterglow phase|Alkiviadis Vlasis|KU Leuven|We present high resolution numerical simulations in 1D and 2D of two ultra-relativistic shells colliding in the afterglow phase of a GRB. For the 1D case we construct optical and radio light curves and examine the occurrence of flares assuming a spherical explosion and a hard-edged jet scenario. We establish a connection between the characteristics of the flare and the properties of the flow. For the 2D case we examine the propagation of a narrow 2 degrees half-opening angle jet and investigate the dynamical effects resulting from the energy injection in the external shell. We find an angular dependency of the collision time due to extraction of energy from the external shock and comment on the signatures this behaviour might have in optical light curves.|Vlasis|Alkiviadis~!
3|4|talk|Simulations of GRB Jets in a Stratified External Medium: Dynamics, Afterglow Lightcurves, Jet Breaks and Radio Calorimetry|Fabio De Colle|University of California at Santa Cruz|We present the first multi-dimensional simulations of the dynamics of GRB jets for both uniform and stratified external media. The simulations are performed in two dimensions using a newly developed, special relativistic, adaptive mesh refinement hydrodynamics code. 
We describe the differences in the dynamics of the GRB jet as a function of the stratification of the ambient medium and, by post-processing the results of the simulations with a radiation code, we compute the afterglow emission from the GRB as it decelerates from highly relativistic to Newtonian velocities. The implications for observations of the afterglow lightcurves, jet breaks and radio calorimetry are described in detail in the talk.|De Colle|Fabio~!
3|1|talk|Scaling Properties of Afterglow Radiation|Andrew MacFadyen and Hendrik van Eerten|New York University|I will present recent progress in calculating the dynamics of
afterglow jets and the electromagnetic transients they produce.  I
will demonstrate that the full dynamics, and even the light curves
themselves, can be arbitrarily scaled in energy and circumstellar
density. We have performed high-resolution two-dimensional
hydrodynamical calculations of afterglow jets with a range of initial
opening angle which can be scaled to fit broadband afterglow light curves
observed from arbitrary viewing angle.  The results of the simulations
are condensed into a few functions which we incorporate into an
iterative fitting code which will be available at

4|3|talk|Long gamma-ray bursts from interacting binaries|Ross Church [1], Melvyn Davies [1], Andrew Levan [2], Chunglee Kim [3]|[1] Lund University, [2] University of Warwick, [3] West Virginia University|The origin of long-duration gamma-ray bursts in the core-collapse of
rapidly-rotating massive stars is well supported by observations. However, it is difficult to prevent the progenitor's spin being braked by strong winds on the main sequence.  This prevents the post-core-collapse accretion disc forming.  The problem is worsened by recent observations of long gamma-ray bursts in high-metallicity regions.  I will show that, in a close binary, it is possible to replenish the spin of the star's core using tides to extract angular momentum from the binary's orbit.  This mechanism requires the progenitor to be in a close binary with a black hole.  I will show that this scenario naturally predicts features in the accretion history that can be tested using light curves of long gamma-ray bursts.|Church|Ross~!
4|2|talk|Binary Progenitors for Long-Duration Gamma-Ray Bursts|Philipp Podsiadlowski|Oxford University|In this talk I review recent progress on binary progenitor models for
long-duration gamma-ray bursts, involving tidal spin-up models, merger
models and explosive common-envelope ejection. Most of these models
require a late binary interaction (so-called Case C mass transfer) and
work better at lower metallicity. However, unlike some popular
single-star models, this is not required and may prove to be an
important discriminant. Indeed, this is
consistent with recent evidence that LGRBs do not avoid high-Z host galaxies.  Estimates for the various channels are consistent with an estimated LGRB rate of $\sim 10^{-5} $yr$^{-1}$ in
a typical galaxy, in particular, if the newly recognized mode of Case
D mass transfer contributes to the LGRB rate.|Podsiadlowski|Philipp~!
4|0|talk|The supernovae of gamma-ray bursts|David Bersier|Liverpool John Moores University|The connection between long GRBs and supernovae is now well established. I will review the evidence in favor of - or against - it. I will attempt to separate solid facts from  weak evidence, interesting clues from red herrings. I will also look at what we  can learn from looking at SNe not associated with GRBs and see how GRBs fit into the broad picture of stellar explosions.|Bersier|David~!

Mainly I would like to review the history and current status of collapsar model and magnetar model. I would like to present my numerical simulations of collapsar model using 2D/3D Generala Relativistic MHD code. I would like to explain Blandford-Znajek Process as a possible key process of the engine of LGRBs. I would also like to show our 2D MHD simulations of magnetar model.|Nagataki|Shigehiro~!
5|2|talk|Model of the extended emission of short gamma-ray bursts|Alexei Pozanenko [1], Maxim Barkov [2,1]|[1] Space Research Institute, [2] Max-Planck-Institut fur Kernphysik|The existence of extended emission (EE) is an intriguing property of short-duration gamma-ray bursts: the nature of the EE is still unclear. We consider short gamma-ray bursts, emphasizing the common properties of both short bursts and short bursts with EE. We propose a two jet model which can describe both short main episode of hard spectra emission, specific for short bursts, and softer spectra EE by different off axis position of observer. The model involves a short-duration jet, which is powered by heating due to neutrino annihilation, and a long-lived Blandford–Znajek jet with a significantly narrow opening angle. The model is a plausible mechanism for short-duration burst energization. It can explain short bursts both with and without EE within a single class of progenitor|Pozanenko|Alexei~!
5|1|talk|Energy injection in short GRBs and the role of magnetars|A. Rowlinson [1], P.T. O'Brien [2]|[1] University of Amsterdam, [2] University of Leicester|A significant fraction of the Long Gamma-ray Bursts (GRBs) in the Swift sample show a plateau phase which may be due to ongoing energy injection. We find many Short GRBs detected by the Swift satellite show similar behavior. The remnant of NS-NS mergers may not collapse immediately to a BH (or even collapse at all) forming instead a magnetar. This model predicts that there would be a plateau phase in the X-ray lightcurve followed by a shallow decay phase, if it is a stable magnetar, or a steep decay if the magnetar collapses to a BH. By fitting this model to all of the Short GRB BAT-XRT lightcurves, we find that a significant fraction may show evidence of energy injection by a magnetar. This model can be tested using the next generations of gravitational wave observatories.|O'Brien|Paul~!
5|0|talk|The multi-messenger picture of compact binary mergers|S.Rosswog|Jacobs University Bremen|The merger of compact binary systems are generally considered as the standard
central engines of sGRBs, but this hypothesis is far from being proven.
Progress is expected from combining the information obtained in different channels.
I will discuss the signatures extracted from a large set of simulated compact binary
mergers. They include gravitational waves and neutrinos, but the main focus will be
on the electromagnetic signatures that result from the dynamically ejected
matter. I will also discuss the potential of dynamical collisions of compact objects
as sGRB engines and the question in which ways such collisions differ from
gravitational wave driven mergers.|Rosswog|Stephan~!
6|2|talk|Gamma-ray Burst Host Galaxies as Probes of Galaxy Formation and Evolution|Emily Levesque|University of Colorado at Boulder|Host galaxies are an excellent means of probing the natal environments that generate gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Surveys of long-duration GRB (LGRB) host environments and their ISM properties have produced intriguing new results with important implications for LGRB progenitor models. These host studies are also critical in evaluating the utility of LGRBs as potential tracers of star formation and metallicity at high redshifts, particularly when considering the implications for properties of host galaxies above z = 6. I will summarize the latest research on LGRB host galaxies, and discuss the resulting impact on our understanding of these events: progenitors, energetics, afterglow properties, and cosmological applications.|Levesque|Emily~!
6|3|talk|The Host Galaxies of Dust-Obscured Gamma-Ray Bursts|Daniel Perley|Caltech|I will present the latest observations from major programs on Spitzer, HST, Keck, and Gemini targeting the hosts of over 20 GRBs with highly dust-suppressed afterglows, as well as efforts to search for long-wavelength host emission using the EVLA and CSO.  Many dark GRB hosts are extremely red and IR-luminous, suggesting that GRBs can indeed form in massive and metal-enriched systems, bolstering their utility as a cosmic SFR probe and imposing important constraints on the progenitor.  However, radio/submillimeter observations indicate they are mostly not super-starbursting galaxies like local ULIRGs.  Many other dark GRB hosts are actually quite blue and have low stellar masses, confirming that even ordinary and seemingly dust-free systems can host significant obscured star formation.|Perley|Daniel~!

7|1|talk|GRBs as standard  candles indicated by pulse spectral evolution|Rupal Basak, A. R. Rao|Tata Institute of Fundamental Research, Mumbai|We analyze the time-resolved spectra of bright, long, single/separable pulses of Fermi GRBs. We find that the peak energy/temperature always decreases exponentially with fluence in the later part. We investigate multiple spectral components in the initial rising part and provide a comprehensive empirical description of the spectral and timing behavior of single pulses. We extend the work of Basak & Rao (2012a ApJ745,76; 2012b ApJ, acc.) to make a pulse-wise parametrization of GRBs. We analyze all Fermi GRBs with known redshifts and demonstrate that the peak energy/kT at zero fluence shows a very strong correlation with the energy of  individual pulses. This work strongly extends the possibility of using GRB pulses as standard candles and the spectral parameters as a proxy for redshift.|Basak|Rupal~!
7|3|talk|Galaxy counterparts of high-z sub-DLAs/DLAs towards GRBs|Steve Schulze|University of Iceland|Until now, seven intervening sub-DLAs and DLAs have been reported towards six GRBs. Although their chemical composition and frequency is known from quasar studies, the knowledge of their galaxy counterparts is limited. In this talk, I present the findings on the first systematic search for galaxy counterparts of intervening sub-DLAs/DLAs towards GRBs. To identify their galaxy counterparts, very deep imaging campaigns and low-resolution spectra were used. This approach allowed the identification of one high-z DLA galaxy. I also discuss the limits on the non-detections and report a redshift co-incidence of different objects associated with metal-lines in the same field that are separated by 137-161 kpc.|Schulze|Steve~!
7|2|talk|Difficulties in using GRBs as Standard Candles|Adam Goldstein|University of Alabama in Huntsville|GRBs have been detected uniformly over the observable universe, ranging in comoving distance from a few hundred Mpc to a few thousand Mpc. For this reason there have been extensive studies into the possibility of using GRBs as standard candles. We discuss the attempts at defining GRBs as standard candles, such as the search for a robust luminosity indicator, pseudo-redshift predictions, the complications that emission collimation introduces into the estimation of the energetics, and the difficulty introduced by the widely varying observed properties of GRBs. These topics will be examined with data and analyses from both Fermi and Swift observations. Problems with current studies using GRBs as standard candles will be noted as well as potential paths forward to solve these problems.|Goldstein|Adam~!

I will discuss the promise of GRB afterglows for pinpointing the locations of their faint host galaxies, and providing, via spectroscopy, information about their environments and the IGM that cannot be obtained by other means.  I will also review progress to-date in locating and studying GRB afterglows at very high-z, and consider prospects for the future.|Tanvir|Nial~!

Pal'shin|Ioffe Physico-Technical Institute, St. Peresburg, Russian Federation|We present a short review of GRB studies being performed for many years by Ioffe Institute onboard a number of space missions. The first breakthrough in the studies of GRB was made possible by four Konus experiments carried out by the Ioffe Institute onboard the Venera 11 to 14 deep space missions in 1978 to 1983. A new important stage of our research  is associated with joint Russian-American experiment with the Russian Konus scientific instrument onboard the U.S. Wind spacecraft which has been successfully operating since its launch in November 1994. The Konus-Wind experiment has made an impressive number of important GRB observations and other astrophysical discoveries, due to the advantages of its design and its interplanetary locations. We also discuss our future GRB experiments.|Aptekar|Rafail~!

(Pi of the Sky Collaboration)|Center for Theoretical Physics PAS|Pi of the Sky is a system of  wide field-of-view  robotic telescopes, which search for short timescale astrophysical phenomena, especially for prompt optical GRB emission. The system was designed for autonomous operation, following the predefined observation strategy and adopting it to the actual conditions. Simultaneous observations from locations in Chile and Spain allows for a systematic search of optical transients of cosmological origin.
Accurate analysis of data arising from a wide-field system like Pi of the Sky  is a real challenge because of a number of factors that can influence measurements. We have developed a set of dedicated algorithms which remove poor quality measurements, improve photometric accuracy and allow us to reach uncertainties  as low as 0.015 – 0.02 mag.|Siudek|Malgorzata~!

(Jerry) Fishman|NASA-Marshall Space Flight Center|The BATSE experiment on the Compton Gamma-ray Observatory was the first large detector system specifically designed for the study of gamma-ray bursts. The eight large-area detectors allowed full-sky coverage and were optimized to operate in the energy region of the peak emission of most GRBs.  BATSE provided detailed observations of the temporal and spectral characteristics of large samples of GRBs, and it was the first experiment to provide rapid notifications of the coarse location of many them.  It also provided strong evidence for the cosmological distances to GRBs through the observation of the sky distribution and intensity distribution of numerous GRBs.  The origin and development of the BATSE experiment, some highlights from the mission and its continuing legacy will be described.|Fishman|Gerald~!

1. Dedicated and commensal real-time monitoring programmes enabling detection and monitoring of radio afterglows.
2. Rapid, automated response to targets of opportunity.
3. A raw data buffer, providing the ability to "re-observe" past events at high time, spectral and spatial resolution.

Cline|Goddard Space Flight Center, Emeritus|The early studies of astronomical gamma ray transients are reviewed, with emphasis on our involvements and related developments, e.g., the first gamma ray burst detections and the creation of the Interplanetary Network. I interpreted the 1979 March 5 event as unique, whereas this initial IPN success appeared to ironically complicate and deepen the mystery of GRBs, with other views that its N49 snr id. was accidental or that it suggested nearby n-star origins. Other early experiments are outlined, e.g. our Shuttle Gamma-Dome that inspired the CGRO-BATSE, the Ge GRB spectrometer, and the Solar Polar Mission, reduced to the successful but no longer stereoscopic Ulysses. Other developments prior to the cosmological GRB era, e.g. the resolution of the magnetar/GRB confusion, are outlined.|Cline|Thomas~!

9|1|talk|Neutrinos from GRBs, and the connection to gamma-ray observations|Philipp Baerwald, Svenja H\"ummer, Walter Winter|Universität W\"urzburg|The possibility of GRBs as the source of UHECR is currently starting to get constrained by the non-observation of GRB neutrinos. We therefore reconsider the current neutrino flux predictions
from gamma-ray observations, based on the internal shock model, from the particle physics involved, and numerically calculate the resulting spectra. At the example of the Waxman-Bahcall GRB neutrino flux we demonstrate how additional production modes, synchrotron cooling of secondary particles, and flavor mixing affect the expected neutrino spectrum. We demonstrate that a detailed (numerical) calculation changes the prediction of the GRB neutrino flux from gamma-ray observations, apply this to the recent IC40 GRB results, and discuss systematical and astrophysical uncertainties of this interpretation.|Baerwald|Philipp~!

We account for the dominant biases to calculate a realistic SGRB rate density out to z = 0.5 using the Swift sample of peak fluxes, redshifts, and those SGRBs with a beaming angle constraint from X-ray/optical observations. Assuming a significant fraction of binary neutron star mergers produce SGRBs, we calculate lower and upper detection rate limits of (1-200) per Yr by an ALIGO and Virgo coincidence search. Our detection rate is similar to the lower and realistic rates inferred from extrapolations using Galactic pulsar observations and population synthesis.|Coward|David~!
9|0|talk|GRBs at Neutrino Telescopes|Markus Ahlers|UW Madison|Gamma ray bursts are among the prime suspects as the sources of ultra-high energy (UHE) cosmic rays (CRs). Not only are these objects capable of accelerating nuclei to the extreme energies so far detected but they can also supply enough power to sustain the energy density of UHE CRs. The acceleration of nuclei in the source in the presence of radiation fields from the burst or afterglow leads immediately to the production of high energy neutrinos. I will review the expected neutrino fluxes in the standard GRB fireball model. I will show that the IceCube neutrino observatory has now reached the sensitivity to test these fluxes and challenges the UHE CR paradigm of GRBs.|Ahlers|Markus~!
9|2|talk|Gravitational Waves from Gamma-ray Bursts|Alessandra Corsi|(for the LIGO scientific collaboration and Virgo collaboration)|Gamma-Ray Bursts are likely associated with a catastrophic energy release in stellar mass objects. Electromagnetic observations provide important, but indirect information on the progenitor. On the other hand, gravitational waves emitted from the central source, carry direct information on its nature. In this context, I give an overview of the multi-messenger study of gamma-ray bursts that can be carried out by using electromagnetic and gravitational wave observations. I also underline the importance of joint optical and gravitational wave searches, in the absence of a gamma-ray trigger. Finally, I discuss how multi-messenger observations may probe alternative GRB progenitor models, such as the magnetar scenario. |Corsi|Alessandra~!
22|3|talk|Single- and two-component gamma-ray burst spectra in the Fermi GBM-LAT energy range|P\'eter Veres, P\'eter M\'esz\'aros|Pennsylvania State University|Most Fermi GRB spectra appear as either a broken power law extending to GeV energies or as a broken power with a separate GeV power law component. Here we show that such spectra can be understood in terms of magnetically dominated relativistic jets where a dissipative photosphere produces the prompt MeV emission, which is extended into the GeV range by inverse Compton scattering in the external shock, with possible contributions from a reverse shock as well. The bulk Lorentz factors required in these models are in the range of 300-600, and the MeV-GeV time delays arise naturally. In some cases an optical flash and a sub-dominant thermal component are also present.|Veres|Peter~!
22|1|talk|The Photosphere in Gamma-Ray Bursts: Lessons Learned from Fermi|Felix Ryde|Royal Insitute of Technology|In spite of extensive research over the past decades, a complete physical picture of the origin of the prompt GRB emission is still lacking. The failure of the synchrotron interpretation raises the need for alternatives.  During recent years, though, evidence has been  accumulating that the jet photosphere plays an important role.   I will summarise the lessons learned from Fermi observations regarding the behaviour of the photosphere.  I will concentrate on a few strong and important bursts, namely, GRB090902, GRB100724A, and GRB110721A.   In particular, I will show evidence for sub-photospheric energy dissipation, and show how it can explain the non-thermal spectra seen in many bursts.  Finally, I will discuss some new ideas that may enable us to extract more information from Fermi data.|Ryde|Felix~!

23|1|talk|GRBs have preferred jet opening angles and bulk Lorentz factors|Ghisellini|INAF - Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera|We do not have a valid and robust explanation of the spectral energy correlations. Some light, however, have been shed by the recently found correlation between the bulk Lorentz factor and both the peak energy and the isotropic peak luminosity output of the prompt. Based on this result, we explore its consequences for the spectral energy correlations, finding, through extensive simulations, that they are real. Furthermore GRBs should be characterized by a preferred opening angle of their jets, and a preferred bulk Lorentz factor. These two quantities are related: the narrower the jet angle, the larger the bulk Lorentz factor.|Ghisellini|Gabriele~!

Guiriec [3] on behalf of the GBM team|[1] School of Physics, University College Dublin, [2] CSPAR, University of Alabama in Huntsville, [3] NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|The Fermi Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) has detected over 800 GRBs since its launch in June 2008. Many GRBs exhibit a spectral lag up to ~1 MeV which is seen as high-energy gamma-ray emission arriving earlier than photons in a low-energy band. Here we present the spectral lags of a sample of bright and hard GBM GRBs with simple time profiles. The wide energy coverage of GBM (8 keV - 40 MeV) allows the dependence of the spectral lag on energies up to the MeV range to be investigated for bursts with sufficient signal in the BGO detectors. The relationship between the evolution of the spectral lag with energy and the spectral evolution of the burst is also investigated.|Foley|Suzanne~!

(2002), and other spectral-energy correlations derived from it are one of the most debated topics in GRB science, given their relevance for both GRB physics and cosmology. In particular, in the last years different research groups came to very different conclusions about the impact of selection and instrumental effects on these correlations. We give a critical review of these works and report the results of Monte Carlo simulations and the analysis of large datasets (CGRO/BATSE, BeppoSAX/GRBM, WIND/Konus, Swift/BAT, Fermi/GBM) that we performed in order to shade light on this important issue. We also discuss the reliability and perspectives of using spectral-energy correlations for measuring cosmological parameters up to z~9.|Amati|Lorenzo~!

Hafizi|Institut d'Astrophysique de Paris|Since its discovery the E$_{\mathrm{p}}$ - E$_{\rm iso}$ relation has been a source of controversy between those believing that it is an intrinsic GRB property, that should be directly related to the physics of the prompt emission and others, arguing that it comes from various selection effects (thresholds for burst and afterglow detection, conditions for measuring the redshift and peak energy). In the context of the internal shock model we present Monte-Carlo simulations showing that the observed relation may indeed result from a combination of intrinsic processes and selection effects. While at large E$_{\rm iso}$ we find that the relation can be interpreted in terms of the physics of internal shocks (which do not produce large E$_{\rm iso}$ - low E$_{\rm p}$ events), it appears largely shaped by selection effects at low E$_{\rm iso}$.|Mochkovitch|Robert~!
23|3|talk|On The Lack of Time Dilation Signatures in Gamma-ray Burst Light Curves|Daniel Kocevski|Stanford University|We present an analysis in which we examine the effects of time dilation on the temporal profiles of GRB pulses and the implications this has on our understanding of GRB energetics.  Through the use of simulations, we find that the observer frame duration of individual pulses does not increase with redshift as one would expect from cosmological expansion. Instead, the duration actually decreases as the pulse's signal-to-noise decreases with increasing redshift.  The results of our simulation are consistent with the fact that evidence for time dilation has not materialized in either the Swift or Fermi detected GRBs with known redshift.  We discuss how the measured durations and E$_{\rm iso}$ estimates for GRBs detected near the instrument's detection threshold should be considered as lower limits.|Kocevski|Daniel~!
24|1|talk|Probing GRB afterglows with deep linear and circular polarimetry|K. Wiersema|University of Leicester|Follow-up observations of large numbers of GRBs have produced a large sample of spectra and lightcurves, from which the basic micro- and macrophysical parameters of afterglows may be derived. However, a number of observed phenomena defy explanation by simple versions of the standard fireball model. Polarimetry can be a powerful diagnosis of (new) afterglow physics, probing the magnetic field properties and geometrical effects (e.g. jet breaks). 

We present the first high quality, multicolour, polarimetric curve of a Swift GRB afterglow, using the VLT. We obtained linear polarimetry in R band (0.13 - 2.3 days after burst) as well as K band, and deep circular polarimetry. We combine this unique dataset with multicolour lightcurves to probe models of jet breaks and magnetic field generation.|Wiersema|Klaas~!

De Pasquale [3]|[1] MSSL, [2] MPE, [3] UNLV|At this conference, I will provide evidence for a new intrinsic correlation between the decay rate and brightness of the optical afterglow, determined using a sample of 56 long GRB optical/UV light curves. This correlation has (at least) two possible origins: the energy is released more quickly for bright afterglows, or the energy is released at a similar rate in all afterglows, but we are observing the jets over a wide range of angles. In the latter scenario the fainter, slower-decaying afterglows will be viewed at larger angles than the brighter, faster-decaying afterglows. I will discuss these possible causes and the consequences on GRB afterglow physics. This correlation represents a major step towards toward a full, unified characterisation of the long GRB population.|Oates|Samantha~!
24|3|talk|The prompt-afterglow connection in Gamma-Ray Bursts: a comprehensive statistical analysis of Swift X-ray light-curves|R. Margutti|Harvard University|I present a comprehensive statistical analysis of Swift X-ray light-curves of Gamma-Ray Bursts (GRBs), with more than 650 GRBs. Two questions drive this effort: Does the X-ray emission retain any kind of memory of the prompt phase? Where is the dividing line between long and short GRBs? I show that Short GRBs decay faster, are less luminous and less energetic than long GRB, but are characterized by very similar intrinsic absorption. I furthermore reveal the existence of a number of statistically significant relations that link the X-ray to prompt parameters in long GRBs; short GRBs are outliers of the majority of these 2-par relations. More importantly, I report on the existence of a universal 3-parameter scaling that links the X-ray and the gamma-ray properties of BOTH long and short GRBs|Margutti|Raffaella~!
24|0|talk|Observational Aspects of Gamma-ray Burst Afterglows|Thomas Kruehler|Dark Cosmology Centre|For our understanding of the physics of GRB explosions as well as their implications on star formation and cosmology, it is crucial to observe the luminous afterglow emission. Afterglow observations provide an accurate distance scale to the GRB, and allow us to put constraints on the physical properties of the ultra-relativistic outflow. In the recent years, systematic follow-up campaigns have led to an increasing sample of high-quality afterglow light-curves and multi-wavelength SEDs. The new data sheds light on the properties of the population of long GRBs, including those events that have previously escaped detection.
I will give an overview of the state-of-the-art of the field and highlight new observational results.|Kruehler|Thomas~!

much shorter that the afterglow emission variability time-scales.
The discussion on the nature of X-ray flares and the recent studies on pre and post cursor emission observed in the gamma rays unveiled the possibility that the central engine can be characterized by a much longer activity. In this work we discuss the signatures of late-time central engine activity from a different perspective, i.e., in the temporal and spectral variability of the optical-NIR afterglow. We will discuss these signatures of the long lasting central engine activity unveiled thanks to the rich multicolor light-curves obtained by the GROND instrument.|Nardini|Marco~!

In this study, two dimensional axisymmetric simulations of relativistic hydrodynamics are performed with taking into account both the stellar collapse and the jet propagation. In our simulations, the power of jet is determined by two different origin of central engine (accretion-powered central engine and neutrino-driven central engine). We calculate the accretion rate and the evolution of black hole mass and spin, all of which are necessary to evaluate the jet power. In this conference, I would like to show you a simple jet breakout criteria and also give constraints on the angular momentum distribution of Wolf-Rayet stars to produce GRBs.|Nagakura|Hiroki~!

Sambruna [4]|[1] NASA GSFC, [2] UMBC, [3] Rice, [4] George Mason University|The central engines of AGNs and GRBs share the same basic astrophysical ingredients - despite the vastly different mass scales - and an outstanding question is how the jet physics scales from GRBs to AGNs. Using Fermi and Swift, we show that the jets produced by blazars and long-duration GRBs exhibit similar correlations between the kinetic power and apparent gamma-ray luminosity. After beaming corrections, we find evidence that blazars and GRBs follow the same correlation between the *intrinsic* Lgamma and kinetic power. This result implies that jet production and energy dissipation mechanisms are remarkably similar across 9 orders of magnitude in luminosity. We will discuss the implications of these results in terms of the properties of the central engines.|Nemmen|Rodrigo~!

The jet variability time scale is milliseconds, while the engine must be active for seconds to minutes and possibly even hours. I will first discuss the two popular engine models, accreting black-hole and proto-magnetar, and the constraints that they impose on the progenitor system of both long and short GRBs.  I will then focus on the Collapsar model for long GRBs and on the interaction of a relativistic jet with a stellar envelope. I will show that this interaction leaves an observed signature, which is detectable in the GRB samples of all major satellites, and discuss what can be learned from this signature on the typical GRB engine activity time.|Nakar|Ehud~!

In view of gamma-ray polarization measurement, we consider that the magnetic fields may play an important role in the mechanism of prompt GRB.

The analysis of the prompt phase reveals that this GRB shares many features with the other bright bursts observed by Fermi-LAT during its first 3 years on-orbit. The wealth of multi-wavelength observations allowed
temporal and spectral analyses in different epochs, favoring emission from the forward shock in a wind-type medium. The temporally-extended emission observed by the LAT is most likely the highest-energy extension of the afterglow. Prompt emission from a single zone and forward shock afterglow analysis both lead independently to an estimated jet bulk Lorentz factor of $\Gamma$ ~500.|Bregeon|Johan~!
27|2|talk|GRB observations at very high energies with the MAGIC telescopes|Markus Garczarczyk|Instituto Astrofisica de Canarias|Measurement of the GRB spectra and variability at the GeV range will constrain the ongoing physical processes of these phenomena. More than a decade ago, when the MAGIC telescope was in the design phase, the main goals were to build an IACT with the fastest repositioning speed and lowest energy threshold. These requirements are mandatory for measuring the VHE emission from GRBs. Currently MAGIC is a stereoscopic system of two telescopes operating at an energy threshold of few tens of GeV. The telescopes move to the opposite direction on the sky within less than 20 s. Follow-up observations are carried out with a frequency of ~10 events per year, however, without a significant detection until now. The MAGIC/LAT results and the modeling of the physical parameters of GRB090102 will be shown.|Garczarczyk|Markus~!
31|0|talk|Gamma-ray burst afterglows as probes of the ISM|Patricia Schady|MPE Garching|It has long been recognized that the bright and simple afterglow spectra of GRBs make highly effective probes of the ISM within distant, star-forming galaxies. Nevertheless, to fully exploit their potential, several outstanding issues need to be addressed. Most notably, the absorption imprint left on the X-ray afterglow from intervening material implies an order of magnitude more gas than is measured on optical spectra. I will present results from a comprehensive study on the multi-wavelength attenuation of GRB afterglows, and discuss the implied origin of the X-ray absorption excess. I shall also review current research on the extinction properties of host galaxy dust; a topic highly pertinent to optically `dark’ GRBs and to far-infrared/submm observations of host galaxy dust emission|Schady|Patricia~!

Using X-ray, optical and radio data, I present the most current demographics of short GRBs in terms of their energies, circumburst densities and opening angles. I will then compare these observations to the rates we expect for various progenitor models.|Fong|Wen-fai~!
31|1|talk|Origin of the X-ray absorption in GRBs|Darach Watson|Dark Cosmology Centre|The X-ray absorption in GRBs has been seen as a potential goldmine of information on material invisible at other wavelengths.

However the correct solution to its origin has not been arrived at after more than a decade of work. I will present recent work on the X-ray absorption in GRBs that resolves the  problem of its apparent evolution with redshift by showing that a strong dust obscuration bias is responsible. I will then go on, using UV/optical data to suggest and demonstrate the solution to the remaining outstanding problems, and finally explain the nature of the X-ray absorber.|Watson|Darach~!

Driven by recent highly complete LGRB samples, obtained by GROND over the past 4 years, and new evidence of LGRBs occuring in more massive and metal rich galaxies than previously thought, the possible biases of the LGRBR-CSFH connection are investigated over a large range of galaxy properties.

The EBL can be probed via attenuation features due to gamma-gamma interactions in the 10-100 GeV spectra of high-z GRBs. Furthermore, the electron-positron pairs produced in such interactions can induce delayed secondary emission by scattering the CMB up to hard X-ray to multi-MeV energies, which provide a unique probe of intergalactic magnetic fields as well as the EBL during reionization.

The spectral lags were calculated by fitting the global maximum in the Cross Correlation Function (CCF) by a gaussian function. The uncertainties in the spectral lags were estimated using a Monte Carlo Simulation. We compare our results with the existing Swift results (Ukwatta et al. (2011)).

The longer-lived afterglow radiation seen at lower energies is much smoother and would be difficult to detect in a background-limited instrument such as the Gamma-ray Burst Monitor (GBM) onboard Fermi. Observations above 100 MeV of this type of long-lived emission from bright GBM detected GRBs by the Fermi Large Area Telescope (LAT) suggest the possibility of extended lower-energy gamma-ray emission. In order to search for such emission in GBM GRBs we have developed a new background estimation tool.

Funda Bostanci, Yuki Kaneko, Ersin Gogus|Faculty of Engineering and Natural Sciences, Sabancı University|GRBs are divided into long soft and short hard classes, based on their duration and spectral hardness. Occasionally some GRBs exhibit a softer, low intensity extended emission (EE) component following an initial short-hard spike. These events are considered as a separate population between two classes, although the nature of EE is still unclear. The possibilities for EE include an early X-ray afterglow or a manifestation of the prolong activity of a central engine. During its mission, BATSE recorded 2704 GRBs. Taking advantage of the large BATSE archive we performed a detailed systematic search for short GRBs with EE component. Here we present first results of our search.

Here, we present an extension of the model to describe the high-energy emission of GRB090926A. We first argue that the emission consist of two components, one with a duration less than 1s during the prompt phase and the second a long duration GeV emission lasting hundred of seconds after the prompt phase. The short high-energy emission is described as SSC emission from reverse shock similar to the observed in GRB980923.

34|11|poster|Simulation of high energy emission from gamma-ray bursts and other astronomical sources|Houri Ziaeepour|MPE Garching|High energy gamma-ray has been detected from various astronomical sources including gamma-ray bursts (GRBs). Notably, observations in MeV and GeV bands have shown a delay of up to tens of seconds from low energy photons for high energy photons. The origin of this emission is not well understood. After a brief summary of suggested explanations for these observation, I review a model and its simulations that describe various spectral features of GRBs at high energies. Based on these results and behaviour of plasma in relativistic shocks, I explain the origin of the delayed emission by associating it to trapped electrons in the electromagnetic structure at the shock front. The same process can be involved in the acceleration of cosmic ray to very high energies by e.g. shocks in clusters.|Ziaeepour|Houri~!

34|14|poster|GRBs in the comoving frame: the link between the jet opening angle and the bulk Lorentz factor and the interpretation of the spectral-energy correlations.|G. Ghirlanda|INAF-Osservatorio Astronomico di Brera|I will present the comoving frame properties of GRBs whose $\Gamma_0$ can be estimated from the peak of their afterglow light curve. Typical values of $\Gamma_0$ are ~138 and ~66, if the circum-burst density is constant or if it scales as a wind profile respectively. The distribution of the comoving frame Liso is very narrow  with a typical value ~5e48 erg/s. Intriguingly, there exist tight correlations between E$_{\rm iso}$ or L$_{\rm iso}$ and $\Gamma_0$ which offer a general interpretation scheme for the spectral--energy correlation of GRBs: the E$_p$-E$_{\rm iso}$ and E$_p$-L$_{\rm iso}$ correlations are due to a sequence of $\Gamma_0$ factors. The collimation-corrected correlation, can be explained  if $\theta^2 \times \Gamma_0$=constant. Finally, we find a typical $\theta \times \Gamma_0$ ~ 6-20 in agreement with magnetically accelerated jets models.|Ghirlanda|Giancarlo~!

As a first result, I am going to highlight the spectral analysis of GRBs which triggered the Swift satellite, but not GBM although they were in the field of view of the latter. I will then compare the properties of these GRBs to the full sample of GBM GRBs published in the GBM spectral catalogue.

However, the spectra and light curve are calculated only by superposing blackbody radiation emitted from the photosphere. In order to treat the thermal radiation from GRB jets properly, both the radiative transfer in the jets with complex structures should be taken into account.

We are developing a numerical code to calculate radiative transfer in the relativistic media, based on Monte-Carlo method. The code enables us to calculate the compton scattering by relativistic electrons as a postprocessing in relativistic media with complicate structures obtained by 2D relativistic hydrodynamic calculation.

Here we investigate an alternative scenario where the GRB flow is initially magnetically dominated but contains a subdominant thermal component that cools passively up to the photosphere. We compute the resulting thermal emission and we consistently superimpose a non-thermal contribution produced either by internal shocks or by magnetic dissipation, depending on the remaining magnetization of the jet after its acceleration. Within this picture, we explore the parameter space and compare predictions (light-curves and spectra) with different tentative detections of thermal components in GRB spectra.|Hascoet|Romain~!

The first episode has been fit by a black body plus power-law spectral model. The temperature changes with time following a broken power-law, and the photon index presents a soft-to-hard evolution. The second episode appears to be a canonical GRB. Using the Amati and Atteia relations we determined the cosmological redshift to be $z \sim 0.9 \pm 0.08$ (stat.) $\pm 0.2$ (sys.).

Student, [5] Astronomy Institute - UNAM, [6] ICRANet, Universit\'e de Nice Sophia Antipolis |Following each major mission, the understanding of GRBs has conceptually evolved. From the definition of long and short GRBs after BATSE, to the determination of the distance and energetics following BeppoSAX, pointing to isotropic energies in the range between 10$^{49}$ and 10$^{55}$ ergs and to black holes as their energy sources, the observations by Swift have given the first evidence of a new class of "disguised" short GRBs. These sources, with their sharp spike followed by a prolongued soft tail, appear to be canonical long GRBs exploding in a very low density environment (10$^{-3}$ particles/cm$^3$). They therefore point to binary mergers in galactic halos as their progenitors. The Fermi satellite as well as the indian-russian satellite Coronas-Photon have given the first evidence for the single core collapse of a proto-black hole followed by a canonical long GRB emission. The theoretical understanding of this phenomena is allowing to use these source as standard candles. Members of this family at selected redshifts z = 0.54 for GRB 090618, at z ~ 0.9 estimated for GRB 101023 all the way up to z ~ 8 for GRB 090423 are currently studied. It is clear, therefore, that GRBs are not all different: at least two very different families exist, the one related to merging binary sources and the one corresponding to a single core collapse. The cosmological distribution of such sources will be discussed, as well as the evidence for the observation of the first genuine short GRB.|Ruffini|Remo~!

We examine a total of 84 GRB positions by comparing the observed counts to that expected from an empirical background model, as well as by using a composite likelihood method, to place limits on the combined  0.1-10 GeV flux during the burst's prompt emission. We find no significant excess above the combined background during the prompt emission of the bursts when compared to performing the same analysis on blank regions of the sky. The large difference between out limits and the flux distribution of LAT detected GRBs may indicate that high energy cut-offs in GRB spectra may explain the lack of emission above 100 MeV for a majority of GRBs|Kocevski|Daniel~!

Despite their morphological complexity, we detect evidence of a non stochastic  variability during the overall burst duration – seemingly consistent with a chaotic behavior. The phase space portrait of such variability shows the existence of a well-defined strange attractor underlying the erratic prompt emission structures.

These Chandra observations have been the latest X-ray detections of an afterglow even, up to 21 month after the trigger. The last two Chandra observations in December 2007 and May 2008 suggest a break at about a year after the burst, implying a jet half-opening angle of about 14 degrees, if interpreted as a jet break. As an alternative this break may have a spectral origin. In that case no jet break was observed and the half-opening angle is larger than 15 degrees for a wind medium.

At the end of the slow decline phase of the X-ray and optical afterglow, we have a sudden and prominent rebrightening in the optical band, followed by a fast decay in both bands. This optical rebrightening also appears to show chromatic variations.
We discuss the possible interpretations, with their advantages and drawbacks. We find that it is rather difficult to explain the behavior of GRB100814A within a basic model of single component emission produced by external shocks.

Instead, we clearly detect the host galaxy in optical (GMG, TNG, GTC and NOT) and also in near-infrared (UKIRT and CFHT) bands.  We found that the best fit photometric redshift of the host is ~1.4. Furthermore, we clearly see the offset of 1.4" between the host and the Chandra X-ray afterglow position.

Also, the GRB rate at high redshift provides a strong probe of star formation history in the early universe. While hundreds of GRBs are observed by Swift, it remains difficult to determine the intrinsic GRB rate due to Swift’s complex trigger algorithm (with > 500 trigger criteria). Current studies usually approximate the Swift trigger algorithm by a single detection threshold. To investigate possible systematic biases and explore the intrinsic cosmic GRB rate and luminosity function, we adopt a Monte Carlo approach by simulating all trigger criteria of Swift.

We constrain the dominant selection effects (both instrumental and astrophysical) to identify where the missing GRB redshifts are located. Surprisingly, we find that most of the missing bursts are located in z = 1-3, where the star formation rate is also peaking. We identify two main reasons why GRB redshifts are difficult to obtain in this region: the so-called redshift desert and dust extinction. We also find evidence for an evolution of optical brightness for high redshift bursts. It is actually relatively easier to acquire redshifts of high-z bursts, although the intrinsic rate of these bursts is small.|Coward|David~!

In this diagram, all bursts that obey the Amati relation must lie above some limiting line, although observational scatter is expected to be substantial.  While early bursts with spectroscopic redshifts are consistent with this Amati limit, we find that the bursts from BATSE, Swift, Suzaku, and Konus are all greatly in violation of the Amati limit, and this is true whether or not the bursts have measured spectroscopic redshifts.  This requires that selection effects are dominating these distributions, which we quantitatively identify.  As such, the Amati relation should not be used for cosmological purposes.|Collazzi|Andrew C.~!

Such natal kicks will affect the production of compact BH-NS binaries which are possible GRB progenitors.
We combine population synthesis  with integrations of binary systems within the Galactic potential. We find that in a number of cases, natal kicks are in fact necessary. Further, we find that the distribution of natal kicks would seem to be similar to that of neutron stars. This result is somewhat surprising; in many pictures of stellar-mass black-hole formation, one might have expected black holes to receive kicks having the same momentum (rather than the same speed) as those given to neutron star|Davies|Melvyn~!

39|3|poster|Gamma Ray Burst Cosmology with Gravitational Waves|Xihao Deng|The Pennsylvania State University|Gamma ray bursts (GRBs) are the brightest sources in the universe. With the discovery of correlations between their peak energy and isotropically equivalent gamma ray luminosity or energy, they are being considered as 'standard candle' to measure cosmological parameters. However, this method usually cannot give a precise result and it might have a 'circular' problem. With the recent discovery of the correlation between time resolved peak energy and isotropically equivalent gamma ray luminosity, which is applicable to both long and short bursts, we find that detecting gravitational waves (GWs) from short gamma ray bursts by LIGO can help calibrate the GRB sample and precisely determine the cosmological parameters. Gravitational wave detection from short GRBs can directly determine their luminosity distances and correspondingly their time resolved luminosity without referring to their redshifts. Therefore, we can take advantage of the GW method to calibrate short GRBs with distant long GRBs by their time resolved peak energy and gamma ray luminosity correlation, and thus extend the GRB 'standard candles' to high redshift. This technique will help construct a precise high redshift Hubble diagram and will be complementary with the Type Ia Supernovae counterpart.|Deng|Xihao~!

Complementary an online neutrino multiplet selection allows IceCube to trigger Swift and a network of optical telescopes, which can then identify possible electromagnetic counterparts.

Under different assumptions for the Pop III GRB energetics and formation rate, we show that current upper limits from IceCube-40 and/or the observed gamma-ray background by Fermi-LAT already rule out the most optimistic expectations.

In this work we positionally associate short-hard GRB 100206A with a luminous infrared galaxy (LIRG) whose star-formation rate is $\sim30 _{\odot} $yr$^{-1}$, almost an order of magnitude higher than any previously identified short GRB host.  While these properties could be interpreted to support an association of this GRB with very recent star formation, the broadband SED shows that a substantial mass of older stars is present, resulting in a relatively modest specific SFR (0.5 Gyr$^{-1}$).

40|6|poster|The Herschel view of dust in GRB host galaxies|Leslie Hunt|INAF-Osservatorio Astrofisico di Arcetri|Evidence is mounting that some (long) GRB host galaxies are metal rich, massive, and dusty, with high star-formation rates, rather than the low-metallicity, low-mass hosts commonly found at z less than 1. We present new Herschel sub-mm observations of a small sample of GRB host galaxies, associated with dark GRBs, and compile spectral energy distributions (SEDs) which span roughly
a factor of 1000 in wavelength.  SED fitting gives stellar mass, bolometric
luminosity, and star-formation rate, and we discuss these results in the
context of galaxy demographics at redshifts up to 2.|Palazzi|Eliana~!
