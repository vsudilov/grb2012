\noindent Although the Fermi observatory has reported delayed onsets of GeV emissions, the photon statistic is not sufficient to distinguish the emission mechanisms. Future multi-GeV observations such as CTA may give us precise lightcurves that can be compared with lower energy bands. In this talk we show our time-dependent simulations for leptonic and hadronic models. Our results suggest that the multi-GeV lightcurves are powerful tool to probe the GeV emission mechanisms.
