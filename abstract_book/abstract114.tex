\noindent Using 122 swift long GRBs we investigate the redshift dependence of E_p-E_{iso} correlation of GRBs. 
We take the sample of long GRBs in redshift range 0.125 to 8.3 and 
divide the sample into groups with high and low redshift bands. We derive the correlation parameters for each group separately using a Monte Carlo method and compare the correlations for low and high redshift groups.
We also study the luminosity dependence of the correlation.
