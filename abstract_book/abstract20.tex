\noindent I will present recent progress in calculating the dynamics of
afterglow jets and the electromagnetic transients they produce.  I
will demonstrate that the full dynamics, and even the light curves
themselves, can be arbitrarily scaled in energy and circumstellar
density. We have performed high-resolution two-dimensional
hydrodynamical calculations of afterglow jets with a range of initial
opening angle which can be scaled to fit broadband afterglow light curves
observed from arbitrary viewing angle.  The results of the simulations
are condensed into a few functions which we incorporate into an
iterative fitting code which will be available at
