\noindent We have studied X-ray and optical temporal evolutions for 49 GRBs. Our investigation shows that most of optical properties can be interpreted by external model and implies the observed optical emission are afterglows. However, 10 GRBs show shallow decay properties in their overall optical light curve. We further investigated  the 10 GRBs and found that corresponding shallow decay properties were also found in their X-ray light curve. Our results indicates most of shallow decay in both X-ray and optical are external-shock origin. The detailed discussion will present in our poster.
