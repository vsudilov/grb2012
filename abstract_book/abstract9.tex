\noindent We discuss the systematic time-resolved analysis of the brightest gamma-ray bursts observed by the Gamma ray Burst Monitor (GBM) on Fermi up to the end of 2011, where the prompt spectra show evidence for photospheric emission. We use the observed spectral parameters to determine the dynamics of the outflow in each burst. This extensive sample illustrates that photospheric emission may be present to a greater or lesser degree in each burst, depending on the level of subphotospheric dissipation present.
